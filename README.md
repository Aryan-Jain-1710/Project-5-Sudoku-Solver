## Purpose
I created this project to learn more about backtracking algorithms and to practice my Python skills. Due to my avid interest in sudoku, I wanted to create a sudoku solver that would be capable of solving any sudoku. I also wanted to add the functionality to show all permutations visually and to display the number of times the program ran to arrive at the solution. 


## Technologies and Libraries Used
- Programming Language
    - Python

## Setup
Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed.


## Repository Information
This repository has a single main.py python file.


## Usage
To use the application:
- Edit the two-dimensional board variable in main.py to contain the sudoku you want to solve. Use 0 for empty spaces.
- Run the main.py file.
- The program will display the original board and the solved board with the number of times the application ran to arrive at the solution.
- The main.py file can be edited to display all permutations visually.
